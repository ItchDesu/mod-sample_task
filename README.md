## Description

WebRTC-based voice chat example for [Luanti](https://luanti.org/).

The mod provides a `/voice` command that requests a session link from a
signaling server and sends it to the player. Opening the link in a browser
joins the voice chat room with a WebRTC client.

Set the `voicechat_signaling_url` setting in `minetest.conf` to point to your
signaling server.
